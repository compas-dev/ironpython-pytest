> Ridiculously minimal and incomplete pytest replacement for IronPython.

This is **not** an attempt to fork [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) to IronPython (as the abandoned `pytest-ironpython`), instead it's intended to provide the bare minimum for a drop-in replacement of a subset of `pytest` conventions and framework required to run unit tests on IronPython.

It makes a ton of assumptions and has very little configurability.

Deal with it.
